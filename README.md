# object-placement (FOPA)

This is a repository for the IE643 project. The task is object placement. The contents include majority of the code files. The dataset, pretrained encoder weights, and final architecture weights are not pushed due to size restrictions. They will be made available on the drive.

The dataset needs to go in the ./data/data/ directory

The pretrained encoder also goes in the ./data/data/ directory

Final architecture weights are to be placed in ./ directory

requirements.txt provides the necessary libraries for setting up the environment
